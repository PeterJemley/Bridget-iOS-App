## Concurrency Testing Strategy

### Static Analysis (Build Time)
1. **SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY=complete:** Enforces strict concurrency checking
2. **Actor Isolation:** Validates all `@MainActor` annotations
3. **Data Race Prevention:** Ensures thread-safe access patterns
4. **SwiftData Safety:** Verifies model context thread isolation

### Runtime Validation (Real Device)
1. **Main Thread Checker:** Catches UI-thread violations at runtime
2. **Custom Runtime Assertions:** Strategic `precondition(Thread.isMainThread)` checks
3. **Thread Safety Validation:** Critical methods protected with assertions
4. **Real Device Testing:** Hardware-specific concurrency validation

### Thread Sanitizer (Simulator)
1. **Data Race Detection:** Runtime detection of thread conflicts
2. **Memory Access Validation:** Ensures safe concurrent memory access
3. **Network Operation Safety:** Validates async network operations
4. **SwiftData Integration:** Thread-safe database operations

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
- Complete concurrency validation on real device
- Implement runtime assertions for thread safety
- Enable Main Thread Checker for runtime validation
- Validate Thread Sanitizer on simulator
- Update UI_ELEMENT_MANIFEST.md with concurrency testing results

### Future Enhancements
- Instruments Concurrency template for detailed thread analysis
- Additional runtime assertions for edge cases

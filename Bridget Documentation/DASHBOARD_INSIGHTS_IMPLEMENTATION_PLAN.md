# üèóÔ∏è Proactive Stepwise Coding Plan for Dashboard Insight Cards

**Last Updated:** July 17, 2025

> **Testing Policy:** All tests for SwiftData methods must be written using XCTest, follow a proactive stepwise plan, comply with Apple's SwiftData guidelines, and be discoverable and runnable in Xcode.

This document outlines a modular, actionable plan for implementing four key dashboard insight cards in the Bridget app. Each phase is designed for smooth progress, easy testing, and maintainability.

## üìà Overall Recommendations for Dashboard Metrics

- **Trade œÉ for Ranges:** Standard deviation is great for analysts, but everyday users grasp ‚Äú5‚Äì10‚Äâmin‚Äù far better than ‚ÄúŒº=7‚Äâmin, œÉ=2‚Äâmin.‚Äù
- **Always show time horizons:** Prefix every stat with ‚ÄúOver the last X days/weeks‚Äù so nobody misinterprets the raw numbers.
- **Use labels, not raw numbers:** ‚ÄúRarely,‚Äù ‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù ‚ÄúOften‚Äù map directly to user intuition; behind the scenes you can tie them to quartiles or fixed cutoffs.
- **Visualize distributions:** A small histogram or sparkline can show the full spread of delays or strengths at a glance.
- **Keep math off the main UI:** If you really need to expose median or percentiles, tuck them into a ‚ÄúMore details‚Äù drill-down, not the headline stats.

By reframing each of these calculations into user-centric language, time-bounded metrics, and intuitive visuals (ranges, bars, labels), you‚Äôll turn a suite of ‚Äúadvanced statistics‚Äù into actionable insights that drive better decisions‚Äîwithout ever mentioning œÉ or quartiles on the surface.

## Phase 1: Data Layer Preparation

### Statistical Best Practices & Implementation Notes

- **Use unbiased estimators** (divide by N-1 for sample œÉ) unless you are truly working with the full population.
- **Compute true medians** for even N by averaging the two center values.
- **Handle outliers** by considering trimmed means or reporting percentile ranges (e.g., 10‚Äì90th percentile).
- **Fix time windows** (e.g., always use the last 30 days) for rate calculations to avoid retroactive changes.
- **Suppress or annotate metrics** for small sample sizes (e.g., ‚Äúonly 2 openings in this period‚Äù).
- **Prefer ranges and percentiles** over mean¬±œÉ, especially for skewed data.
- **Label rates and rankings** clearly, and indicate ties or statistical similarity when differences are small.
- **Edge case handling:** Always check for empty sets, tiny N, and calendar rounding issues.

### Data Queries to Implement

1. **Event counts by hour/day (for heatmap)**
   - Group events by hour or day using `openDateTime`.
   - Return a dictionary of counts for each time bucket.
   - Always specify the time window (e.g., "last 30 days").
   - Write unit tests for this method in BridgetCoreTests.swift, covering normal and edge cases.

2. **Average duration by day/week**
   - Group completed events by day or week.
   - Compute average, median, and percentile ranges for `minutesOpen`.
   - Return both a typical range (e.g., 25th‚Äì75th percentile) and a callout for tail risk (e.g., ‚Äú10% of events > 15 min‚Äù).
   - Write unit tests for this method in BridgetCoreTests.swift, covering normal and edge cases.

3. **Monthly event counts**
   - Group events by month.
   - Return counts and annotate months with very low event numbers.
   - Write unit tests for this method in BridgetCoreTests.swift, covering normal and edge cases.

4. **Per-bridge stats (frequency, avg duration, impact)**
   - For each bridge, compute:
     - Event frequency (rate per fixed window, e.g., per week or per month)
     - Average and median duration
     - Impact label (e.g., ‚ÄúRarely,‚Äù ‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù ‚ÄúOften‚Äù) based on quartiles or business rules
   - Suppress or annotate stats for bridges with very few events.
   - Write unit tests for this method in BridgetCoreTests.swift, covering normal and edge cases.

5. **Cascade Strength and Delay Stats (if applicable)**
   - For cascade events, compute mean, median, unbiased œÉ, and percentile ranges for strength and delay.
   - Prefer reporting ranges and typical values over raw œÉ.
   - Use robust quantile methods for thresholds, or fix thresholds to business rules.
   - Write unit tests for this method in BridgetCoreTests.swift, covering normal and edge cases.

6. **Top Bridges by Rate**
   - Sort bridges by event rate (over a fixed window).
   - Show actual rates and indicate ties or statistical similarity.
   - Smooth rates over a rolling window to avoid one-off spikes.
   - Write unit tests for this method in BridgetCoreTests.swift, covering normal and edge cases.

### Unit Testing
- Write unit tests for each query, including edge cases (empty sets, small N, even/odd N, outliers).
- Validate that all queries return user-friendly, time-bounded, and robust results.

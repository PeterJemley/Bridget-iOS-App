# UI Element Manifest - Bridget Bridge Events App

## Overview
This document tracks the UI elements and their behaviors in the Bridget bridge events app, focusing on loading states, transitions, user experience, and the data-driven statistical analysis system.

## Core UI Components

### BridgesListView
**File:** `Bridget/BridgesListView.swift`

#### State Management
- **Atomic State System:** Uses `LoadingState` enum with `Equatable` conformance for synchronized UI updates
- **States:** `initial`, `loading`, `loaded`, `error(String)`
- **State Properties:**
  - `isFetching`: Returns `true` only when in `.loading` state
  - `shouldShowSkeletons`: Returns `true` only when in `.loading` state
  - `shouldShowRealData`: Returns `true` only when in `.loaded` state

#### Loading Experience
- **Skeleton Loading:** 5 placeholder bridge cards with `.redacted(reason: .placeholder)`
- **Progress Indicator:** Shows in navigation bar area during loading with fade transitions
- **Fade Animations:** `.transition(.opacity)` and `.animation(.easeInOut)` for smooth state changes
- **Automatic Data Loading:** Data loads automatically on app launch if no cached data exists

#### Layout and Safe Areas
- **Navigation View Style:** `StackNavigationViewStyle()` for proper navigation behavior
- **Safe Area Handling:** `.safeAreaInset(edge: .top)` to prevent content under Dynamic Island
- **Bottom Padding:** 20pt padding at bottom of scroll view for safe area clearance
- **Dynamic Island Compatibility:** Content properly respects top safe area boundaries

#### Error Handling

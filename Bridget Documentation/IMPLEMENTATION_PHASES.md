# Bridget Implementation Phases

**Purpose**: Proactive, stepwise implementation phases for the Bridget iOS app rebuild
**Target**: Xcode 16.4+, iOS 18.5+, Swift 6.0+, SwiftUI 6.0+, SwiftData 2.0+
**Approach**: Phase-based development with clear deliverables and success criteria

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation phases for rebuilding Bridget from scratch, incorporating lessons learned from the legacy implementation while leveraging the latest Apple technologies. Each phase has defined deliverables, time estimates, and success criteria to ensure systematic progress.

### Implementation Philosophy
- **Proactive Planning**: All phases planned upfront with clear dependencies
- **Stepwise Execution**: Each phase builds upon the previous with validated deliverables
- **Quality Gates**: Success criteria must be met before proceeding to next phase
- **Risk Mitigation**: Early identification and resolution of potential issues

## Phase 0: Foundation & Planning (Week 1)

### 0.1 Project Setup & Architecture Design
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Deliverables**: Project structure, architecture documentation, development environment

#### Tasks
- **Create New Xcode Project**
  - iOS 18.5+ target with Swift 6.0+
  - SwiftUI App template with SwiftData integration
  - Modular package structure (10+ packages)
  - Development environment configuration

- **Design Modular Architecture**
  - Define package dependencies and relationships
  - Create package naming conventions
  - Design shared interfaces and protocols
  - Establish data flow patterns

- **Setup Development Environment**
  - Configure Xcode 16.4+ with latest tools
  - Setup SwiftLint and SwiftFormat
  - Configure Git hooks for code quality
  - Setup continuous integration pipeline

#### Success Criteria
- Project compiles successfully with modular structure
- All packages properly linked and accessible
- Development environment fully configured
- Architecture documentation complete

### 0.2 Data Architecture & Models
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Deliverables**: SwiftData models, data layer architecture

#### Tasks
- **Design SwiftData Models**
  - DrawbridgeEvent with proper indexing
